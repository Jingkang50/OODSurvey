> Matrix Sketching: input matrix A is efficiently approximated with a more compact matrix B (or product of a few matrices) so that B preserves most of the properties of A up to some guaranteed approximation ratio. We prove general results showing that any sketch of a matrix that satisfies a certain operator norm guarantee can be used to approximate these scores. We instantiate these results with powerful matrix sketching techniques such as Frequent Directions and random projections to derive efficient and practical algorithms for these problems.
